Basically, this is a project team (started by me, Dalan, and my good buddy Mystery) to develop a game idea.
There's a few other members that joined subsequently, so kudos to them. (So far it's been Angel and Patrick)
The game we're working on is called Strings, in loose reference to the mythological "red string of fate".
We haven't created the actual game yet, (and probably won't be finished for a while), but stay tuned for when we do!
Thanks, dudes!
