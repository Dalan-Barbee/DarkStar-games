    <p class="text">Hi there! I'm Dalan, and I'm the one facetious-ly talkling to you via this wonderful thing called "the Internet".
      Now I'm going to talk about myself, because that's what you clicked the link for, right? <br />
      I'm an age between 0 and 20, and I'm a junior. DarkStar was basically started by a conversation between me and my friend, Mystery (if you want to learn about her, go to the link (you know, the one with her name on it).
      Long story short, we agreed to start a game-making team, so we started with planning Strings, and a few weeks later, we had two new recruits, and this became a website (happy ending yay!). <br />
      Some of my many hobbies include:
      <ul class="text">
        <li>Geek games</li>
        <li>Programming</li>
        <li>Learning guitar</li>
        <li><a href="quotes.html">Quoting people</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text">I love to learn just about anything, and I'm seemingly always persuing a new interest.</p>
      <p class="text">If I had to list my top three favorite movies, they would be:</p>
      <ol class="text">
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLCn88bfW1o" target="blank">Venom</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wd5KEaOtm4" target="blank">Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</a></li>
        <li>Anything with <a target="blank" href="https://www.marvel.com/characters">superheroes</a> (except Thor, Marvel ruined him.)</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text">I also love mythology, <a href="../Prose_Edda.pdf" target="blank">specifically Icelandic</a> (Othin, Balder, Thor, etc), but I love learning about cool or funny characters from anywhere.</p>
      <p class="text">Okay, I think I've bored you enough for now! So yeah, feel free to go back to your cat videos and memes and stuff now. Or, you know, read about the other wonderful people making this work.</p>
      <p class="text">If you're still bored enough to stay on this website, <a href="Music\DalanMusic.html">here's a bit o' music.</a></p>
