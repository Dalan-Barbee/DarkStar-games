Maybe all these desperate clashing feelings I'm feeling are just random brain activity, maybe I'm just delusional. But there are things that I miss, and things that I feel like I should be seeing and feeling every time I turn around, and I just keep turning and turning and turning, and there's nothing.

Music is not a fucking soda. It is not a fucking insurance rate. It is not a fucking T-shirt. It is the only real religion that is worth devoting your soul to. It is the last remnant of the primal scream, the funeral dirge, and the wedding march. It is the light that keeps me out of the shadows, and it is the reason my immortal soul is not in dire straits.

Oh, hey, maybe I should have mentioned that my friends are retarded douchebags.

Every time you look up at the stars, it’s like opening a door. You could be anyone, anywhere. You could be yourself at any moment in your life. You open that door and you realize you’re the same person under the same stars. Camping out in the backyard with your best friend, eleven years old. Sixteen, driving alone, stopping at the edge of the city, looking up at the same stars. Walking a wooded path, kissing in the moonlight, look up and you’re eleven again. Chasing cats in a tiny town, you’re eleven again, you’re sixteen again. You’re in a rowboat. You’re staring out the back of a car. Out here where the world begins and ends, it’s like nothing ever stops happening.

The decent moderation of today will be the least of human things tomorrow. At the time of the Spanish Inquisition, the opinion of good sense and of the good medium was certainly that people ought not to burn too large a number of heretics; extreme and unreasonable opinion obviously demanded that they should burn none at all.

Rockin' and rollin' my way through town
Yeah, baby, I get around
Make mine murder, paint the town red
Squash any spider, hanging by a thread

“Don’t worry, Jiro. The kami would never attack us this close to home… Jiro?”
-Hoto, temple guardian, last words

Home is behind, the world ahead,
And there are many paths to tread
Through shadow, to the edge of night
Until the stars are all alight.
Mist and shadow, cloud and shade,
All shall fade, all shall fade.

A full belly is worth little where the mind is starved.
11-19-18
All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king.

Now, think about this. You could walk across the street against a traffic light and get a summons for jaywalking, but you could walk up to a police officer and say “I want to rule the world,” and there’s nothing he can do about it, that is not a crime. Anybody can want to rule the world.

Besides, where better to put a village than where no one is looking?  And where better to place a path than where no one expects it?

This isn't the first time I've worn dead bodies as clothes. Might be the most fun I've had though. Top three at least.

Did it just get badass in here?

By the way, these are QUOTES. Few of these were originally mine, so (since it’s a pain to cite 500 sources) I give credit wherever it is due.
