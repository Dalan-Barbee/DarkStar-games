        Surt from the south fares With blazing flames; <br>
        From the sword shines <br>
        The sun of the war−god. <br>
        Rocks dash together <br>
        And witches collapse, <br>
        Men go the way to Hel <br>
        And the heavens are cleft. <br>

        Anarchy means “without leaders”, not “without order.” With anarchy comes and age of ordnung, of true order, which is to say voluntary order. <br>
        1-9-19 <br>
        In life we don’t usually get to choose the time of our defining moments. We just have to stand and face them no matter what sort of a state we’re in. <br>

        Only an idiot would jump into the bear cage. <br>
        1-7-19 <br>
        A week into 2019, and I already can’t wait until it’s over. <br>

        Enter the gay portal! <br>
        1-5-19 <br>
        Don’t you look at me in that tone of voice! <br>
        1-4-19 <br>
        How well the man reasoned; lunatics always do in their own scope. <br>
        1-3-19 <br>
        Technology isn’t a villain. Technology should help, but if you just use the technology for the sake of technology, then you’re cheating your audience. <br>

        A case of beer went into the planning. <br>

        ”We will open the book. Its pages are blank. We are going to put words on them ourselves. The book is called Opportunity and its first chapter is New Year’s Day.” <br>

        If you think you’re too small to make a difference, you’ve obviously never spent a night with a mosquito. <br>
        12-29-18 <br>
        No, not “for kids”! We want the good stuff. <br>
        12-28-18 <br>
        No drug, not even alcohol, causes the fundamental ills of society. If we’re looking for the source of our troubles, we shouldn’t test people for drugs. We should test them for stupidity. <br>
        12-27-18 <br>
        Learning softeneth the heart and breedeth gentleness and charity. <br>

        Pity the poor worker who eventually wondered why the tractor had been chugging softly for an hour, put two and two together, and peeked into the hopper. <br>
        12-25-18 <br>
        Listen to this, okay? Just listen. You hear that? That's market bacon hitting the pan. Today a child is born unto us, and his name will be bacon. <br>
        12-24-18 <br>
        Change is… it’s what we get. I guess that’s my problem-I’m always trying to beat the clock, outrun the universe… like nothing can change me as long as I change first. I feel like I’m in this river, just getting swept along… and if I hold on to anyone, if I’m holding on for dear life, I’m not getting anywhere. I’m stuck. I never wanted to get stuck… I’ve never been good at holding on. <br>
        12-23-18 <br>
        Paths are made by walking. <br>

        It's only because of their stupidity that they're able to be so sure of themselves. <br>
        12-21-18 <br>
        They say ignorance is bliss.... they're wrong. <br>

        (Here's a clue about the birthdate of yours truly) <br>
        No more games, I'm a change what you call rage <br>
        Tear this motherf***ing roof off like two dogs caged <br>
        I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed <br>
        I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage <br>
        But I kept rhymin' and stepwriting the next cipher <br>
        Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper <br>
        12-19-18 <br>
        Oh, good. I thought Trump found me. <br>
        12-18-18 <br>
        There art two cardinal sins from which all others spring: Impatience and Laziness. <br>
        12-17-18 <br>
        The truth is always an abyss. One must — as in a swimming pool — dare to dive from the quivering springboard of trivial everyday experience and sink into the depths, in order to later rise again — laughing and fighting for breath — to the now doubly illuminated surface of things. <br>
        12-16-18 <br>
        *whispering* “They have ice cubes, too.” <br>
        12-15-18 <br>
        There’s no such thing as a PENCIL SANDWICH! <br>
        12-14-18 <br>
        Don't bend; don't water it down; don't try to make it logical; don't edit your own soul according to the fashion. Rather, follow your most intense obsessions mercilessly. <br>

        “I do not understand the ways of this tiny god; BUT YOU, YOU WHO ARE YOUNGER AND KNOW THESE COMPUTERS, YOU MUST SPEAK TO THIS TINY GOD AND COMMUNICATE UNTO ME ITS ELECTRONIC WISDOM, FOR I AM BUT MORTAL AND DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO "GOOGLE IT." <br>

        "Kids today! They've been ruined by <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Dungeons & Dragons, comic books, rock music, not working in the steel mill for sixteen hours a day</span>, computers and technology!" <br>
        12-11-18 <br>
        Fuck you fucks and the fucks you fucked in on! <br>
        12-10-18 <br>
        You stole him with your advanced American slut technology! <br>
        12-9-18 <br>
        We are no longer the knights who say Ni! We are now the knights who say ekki-ekki-ekki-pitang-zoom-boing! <br>
        12-8-18 <br>
        So many books, so little time. <br>
        12-7-18 <br>
        “Are we letting her drink beer again?" <br>
        "Hell yes we are, and it's hilarious.” <br>
        [Note: don’t try this at home] <br>
        12-6-18 <br>
        Success is not final, failure is not fatal, it is the courage to continue that counts. <br>
        12-5-18 <br>
        Maybe all these desperate clashing feelings I'm feeling are just random brain activity, maybe I'm just delusional. But there are things that I miss, and things that I feel like I should be seeing and feeling every time I turn around, and I just keep turning and turning and turning, and there's nothing. <br>
        12-4-18 <br>
        People can’t concentrate on blowing other people to pieces properly if their minds are poisoned by thoughts suitable to the twenty-fifth of December. <br>
        12-3-18 <br>
        Music is not a fucking soda. It is not a fucking insurance rate. It is not a fucking T-shirt. It is the only real religion that is worth devoting your soul to. It is the last remnant of the primal scream, the funeral dirge, and the wedding march. It is the light that keeps me out of the shadows, and it is the reason my immortal soul is not in dire straits. <br>
        12-2-18 <br>
        Oh, hey, maybe I should have mentioned that my friends are retarded douchebags. <br>
        12-1-18 <br>
        Every time you look up at the stars, it’s like opening a door. You could be anyone, anywhere. You could be yourself at any moment in your life. You open that door and you realize you’re the same person under the same stars. Camping out in the backyard with your best friend, eleven years old. Sixteen, driving alone, stopping at the edge of the city, looking up at the same stars. Walking a wooded path, kissing in the moonlight, look up and you’re eleven again. Chasing cats in a tiny town, you’re eleven again, you’re sixteen again. You’re in a rowboat. You’re staring out the back of a car. Out here where the world begins and ends, it’s like nothing ever stops happening. <br>
        11-30-18 <br>
        Remember how far you've come, not just how far you have to go. You are not where you want to be, but neither are you where you used to be. <br>
        11-29-18 <br>
        Hunter! Point at the mice! <br>
        11-28-18 <br>
        The decent moderation of today will be the least of human things tomorrow. At the time of the Spanish Inquisition, the opinion of good sense and of the good medium was certainly that people ought not to burn too large a number of heretics; extreme and unreasonable opinion obviously demanded that they should burn none at all. <br>
        11-27-18 <br>
        Rockin' and rollin' my way through town <br>
        Yeah, baby, I get around <br>
        Make mine murder, paint the town red <br>
        Squash any spider, hanging by a thread <br>
        11-26-18 <br>
        “Don’t worry, Jiro. The kami would never attack us this close to home… Jiro?” <br>
        -Hoto, temple guardian, last words <br>
        11-25-18 <br>
        Home is behind, the world ahead, <br>
        And there are many paths to tread <br>
        Through shadow, to the edge of night <br>
        Until the stars are all alight. <br>
        Mist and shadow, cloud and shade, <br>
        All shall fade, all shall fade. <br>
        11-24-18 <br>
        No one has a perfect life. Everybody has something that he wishes was not the way it is. <br>
        11-23-18 <br>
        In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on. <br>
        11-22-18 <br>
        Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever. <br>
        11-21-18 <br>
        No more fear. No more failure. No more death. No more! <br>
        11-20-18 <br>
        A full belly is worth little where the mind is starved. <br>
        11-19-18 <br>
        All that is gold does not glitter, <br>
        Not all those who wander are lost; <br>
        The old that is strong does not wither, <br>
        Deep roots are not reached by the frost. <br>
        From the ashes a fire shall be woken, <br>
        A light from the shadows shall spring; <br>
        Renewed shall be blade that was broken, <br>
        The crownless again shall be king. <br>
        11-18-18 <br>
        A room without books is like a body without a soul. <br>
        11-17-18 <br>
        Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that. <br>
        11-16-18 <br>
        The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool. <br>
        11-15-18 <br>
        It's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring. <br>
        11-14-18 <br>
        The women looked pretty, except when you got near them. <br>
        11-13-18 <br>
        Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe. <br>
        11-12-18 <br>
        Now, think about this. You could walk across the street against a traffic light and get a summons for jaywalking, but you could walk up to a police officer and say “I want to rule the world,” and there’s nothing he can do about it, that is not a crime. Anybody can want to rule the world. <br>
        11-11-18 <br>
        It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light. <br>
        11-10-18 <br>
        My supply of shticks is inexhaustible! <br>
        11-9-18 <br>
        Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships. <br>
        11-8-18 <br>
        We fit like gloves. I think I’m a genius and you agree with me. You’re there for me, and that’s good enough. <br>
        11-7-18 <br>
        A test?! How am I supposed to do a test when I never pay attention in class?!?! <br>
        11-6-18 <br>
        “There’s never anyone home at our house, Noriko-san.” <br>
        “That’s right, because my house embraces liberalism.” <br>
        11-5-18 <br>
        We do not suddenly fall on death, but advance towards it by slight degrees. We die every day. <br>
        11-4-18 <br>
        Crazy’s always better with company. <br>
        11-3-18 <br>
        May you find peace with the knowledge of the good your life has produced rather than the evil into which you were once thrust. <br>
        11-2-18 <br>
        I am on my way to hell, that is, if I am on the right road. <br>
        11-1-18 <br>
        Besides, where better to put a village than where no one is looking?  And where better to place a path than where no one expects it? <br>
        10-31-18 <br>
        This isn't the first time I've worn dead bodies as clothes. Might be the most fun I've had though. Top three at least. <br>
        10-30-18 <br>
        Did it just get badass in here? <br>
        10-29-18 <br>
        We’re stuck on a giant floating sphere in the middle of an endless universe. It’s okay to feel a little lost sometimes. <br>
        10-28-18 <br>
        Some inner voice told me to be cool. I went full fangirl instead. <br>
        10-27-18 <br>
        The only thing you really need to know is the location of the library. <br>
        10-26-18 <br>
        Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind. <br>
        10-25-18 <br>
        I don’t know about everything, not by a long shot. But I do try to keep an open mind, and you’d be surprised by what wanders in sometimes. <br>
        10-24-18 <br>
        If you can believe in Santa for years, you can believe in yourself for a bit. <br>
        10-23-18 <br>
        It’s better to eat an egg then not to. <br>
        10-22-18 <br>
        Many say only God can judge. I don’t think He issues restraining orders. <br>
        10-21-18 <br>
        Hey, laser lips! Your mama’s a snow blower! <br>
        10-20-18 <br>
        Man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed, but not defeated. <br>
        10-19-18 <br>
        The closer one gets to the light, the stronger one’s shadow gets. <br>
        10-18-18 <br>
        “Ooh, shiny! Let’s pull off the chain and take her with us.” <br>
        Ukl, Gruul raider, last words <br>
        10-17-18 <br>
        Many a book is like a key to unknown chambers within the castle of one's own self. <br>
        10-16-18 <br>
        Oh, I just knew you could do it! And both of you are still alive, with intestines intact and all!  Marvelous! <br>
        10-15-18 <br>
        It's a man's curse to see himself only as that which he lacks, and it's his blessing to have friends that have the wisdom to see him as he really is. <br>
        10-12-18 <br>
        Every spirit builds itself a house; and beyond its house, a world; and beyond its world a heaven. Know then, that the world exists for you; build, therefore, your own world. <br>
        <br>
        By the way, these are QUOTES. Few of these were originally mine, so (since it’s a pain to cite 500 sources) I give credit wherever it is due. <br>
