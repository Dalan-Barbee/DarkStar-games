  <h4 class="text">So, I've been gathering quotes for a while, so I figured why not add them to the website. At the very least, it'll hold reader attention for another 30 seconds. So yep, this is a thing now.</h4>

        "Kids today! They've been ruined by Dungeons & Dragons, comic books, rock music, not working in the steel mill for sixteen hours a day, computers and technology!" <br>
        12-11-18 <br>
        Fuck you fucks and the fucks you fucked in on! <br>
        12-10-18 <br>
        You stole him with your advanced American slut technology! <br>
        12-9-18 <br>
        We are no longer the knights who say Ni! We are now the knights who say ekki-ekki-ekki-pitang-zoom-boing! <br>
        12-8-18 <br>
        So many books, so little time. <br>

        “Are we letting her drink beer again?" <br>
        "Hell yes we are, and it's hilarious.” <br>
        [Note: don’t try this at home] <br>
        12-6-18 <br>
        Success is not final, failure is not fatal, it is the courage to continue that counts. <br>
        12-5-18 <br>
        Maybe all these desperate clashing feelings I'm feeling are just random brain activity, maybe I'm just delusional. But there are things that I miss, and things that I feel like I should be seeing and feeling every time I turn around, and I just keep turning and turning and turning, and there's nothing. <br>
        12-4-18 <br>
        Listen to this, okay? Just listen. You hear that? That's market bacon hitting the pan. Today a child is born unto us, and his name will be bacon. <br>
        12-3-18 <br>
        Music is not a fucking soda. It is not a fucking insurance rate. It is not a fucking T-shirt. It is the only real religion that is worth devoting your soul to. It is the last remnant of the primal scream, the funeral dirge, and the wedding march. It is the light that keeps me out of the shadows, and it is the reason my immortal soul is not in dire straits. <br>
        12-2-18 <br>
        Oh, hey, maybe I should have mentioned that my friends are retarded douchebags. <br>

        Every time you look up at the stars, it’s like opening a door. You could be anyone, anywhere. You could be yourself at any moment in your life. You open that door and you realize you’re the same person under the same stars. Camping out in the backyard with your best friend, eleven years old. Sixteen, driving alone, stopping at the edge of the city, looking up at the same stars. Walking a wooded path, kissing in the moonlight, look up and you’re eleven again. Chasing cats in a tiny town, you’re eleven again, you’re sixteen again. You’re in a rowboat. You’re staring out the back of a car. Out here where the world begins and ends, it’s like nothing ever stops happening. <br>
        11-30-18 <br>
        Remember how far you've come, not just how far you have to go. You are not where you want to be, but neither are you where you used to be. <br>
        11-29-18 <br>
        Hunter! Point at the mice! <br>
        11-28-18 <br>
        The decent moderation of today will be the least of human things tomorrow. At the time of the Spanish Inquisition, the opinion of good sense and of the good medium was certainly that people ought not to burn too large a number of heretics; extreme and unreasonable opinion obviously demanded that they should burn none at all. <br>
        11-27-18 <br>
        Rockin' and rollin' my way through town <br>
        Yeah, baby, I get around <br>
        Make mine murder, paint the town red <br>
        Squash any spider, hanging by a thread <br>
        11-26-18 <br>
        “Don’t worry, Jiro. The kami would never attack us this close to home… Jiro?” <br>
        -Hoto, temple guardian, last words <br>
        11-25-18 <br>
        Home is behind, the world ahead, <br>
        And there are many paths to tread <br>
        Through shadow, to the edge of night <br>
        Until the stars are all alight. <br>
        Mist and shadow, cloud and shade, <br>
        All shall fade, all shall fade. <br>
        11-24-18 <br>
        No one has a perfect life. Everybody has something that he wishes was not the way it is. <br>
        11-23-18 <br>
        In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on. <br>
        11-22-18 <br>
        Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever. <br>
        11-21-18 <br>
        No more fear. No more failure. No more death. No more! <br>
        11-20-18 <br>
        A full belly is worth little where the mind is starved. <br>
        11-19-18 <br>
        All that is gold does not glitter, <br>
        Not all those who wander are lost; <br>
        The old that is strong does not wither, <br>
        Deep roots are not reached by the frost. <br>
        From the ashes a fire shall be woken, <br>
        A light from the shadows shall spring; <br>
        Renewed shall be blade that was broken, <br>
        The crownless again shall be king. <br>
        11-18-18 <br>
        A room without books is like a body without a soul. <br>
        11-17-18 <br>
        Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that. <br>
        11-16-18 <br>
        The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool. <br>
        11-15-18 <br>
        It's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring. <br>
        11-14-18 <br>

        11-13-18 <br>
        Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe. <br>
        11-12-18 <br>
        Now, think about this. You could walk across the street against a traffic light and get a summons for jaywalking, but you could walk up to a police officer and say “I want to rule the world,” and there’s nothing he can do about it, that is not a crime. Anybody can want to rule the world. <br>
        11-11-18 <br>
        It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light. <br>
        11-10-18 <br>

        11-9-18 <br>
        Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships. <br>
        11-8-18 <br>
        We fit like gloves. I think I’m a genius and you agree with me. You’re there for me, and that’s good enough. <br>
        11-7-18 <br>
        A test?! How am I supposed to do a test when I never pay attention in class?!?! <br>
        11-6-18 <br>
        “There’s never anyone home at our house, Noriko-san.” <br>
        “That’s right, because my house embraces liberalism.” <br>
        11-5-18 <br>
        We do not suddenly fall on death, but advance towards it by slight degrees. We die every day. <br>
        11-4-18 <br>
        Crazy’s always better with company. <br>
        11-3-18 <br>
        May you find peace with the knowledge of the good your life has produced rather than the evil into which you were once thrust. <br>
        11-2-18 <br>
        I am on my way to hell, that is, if I am on the right road. <br>
        11-1-18 <br>
        Besides, where better to put a village than where no one is looking?  And where better to place a path than where no one expects it? <br>
        10-31-18 <br>
        This isn't the first time I've worn dead bodies as clothes. Might be the most fun I've had though. Top three at least. <br>
        10-30-18 <br>
        Did it just get badass in here? <br>
        10-29-18 <br>
        We’re stuck on a giant floating sphere in the middle of an endless universe. It’s okay to feel a little lost sometimes. <br>
        10-28-18 <br>
        Some inner voice told me to be cool. I went full fangirl instead. <br>
        10-27-18 <br>
        The only thing you really need to know is the location of the library. <br>
        10-26-18 <br>
        Be who you are and say what you feel. Because those you mind don’t matter and those who matter don’t mind! <br>
        10-25-18 <br>
        I don’t know about everything, not by a long shot. But I do try to keep an open mind, and you’d be surprised by what wanders in sometimes. <br>

        It’s better to eat an egg then not to. <br>
        10-22-18 <br>

        Ukl, Gruul raider, last words <br>
        10-17-18 <br>
        Many a book is like a key to unknown chambers within the castle of one's own self. <br>

        Oh, I just knew you could do it! And both of you are still alive, with intestines intact and all!  Marvelous! <br>
        10-15-18 <br>
        It's a man's curse to see himself only as that which he lacks, and it's his blessing to have friends that have the wisdom to see him as he really is. <br>
        10-12-18 <br>
        Every spirit builds itself a house; and beyond its house, a world; and beyond its world a heaven. Know then, that the world exists for you; build, therefore, your own world. <br>
        <br>
        By the way, these are QUOTES. Few of these were originally mine, so (since it’s a pain to cite 500 sources) I give credit wherever it is due. <br>
